In conjunction with the [Kandy JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Kandy-IO), the Kandy VDI Toolkit provides a platform that enables application developers to deliver a HD experience for video and audio calls in a VDI environments. The platform hides the complexities of dealing with thin clients, and server-based computing so that application developers can focus on user capabilities and user experience.
The Kandy VDI Toolkit is installed on the thin client, as well as on the VDI Virtual Desktop. The Kandy JavaScript SDK works with the Kandy VDI Toolkit to co-ordinate the application behavior on the VDI Desktop and the media processing on the thin client.

The Kandy VDI Toolkit separates out the application from the media processing
•	Enabling the application to be securely deployed in the managed environment, while
•	Not impacting performance by running the media between the thin client and the virtual desktop

The Toolkit is currently supported on thin clients running [eLux OS](https://www.unicon-software.com/products/elux/) for use with Citrix Worspace App, using the [Kandy Distant Driver for VDI](https://github.com/Kandy-IO/kandy-distant-vdi)
